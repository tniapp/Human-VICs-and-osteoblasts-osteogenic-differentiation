# Human-VICs-and-osteoblasts-osteogenic-differentiation
This code replicates the bioinformatic analysis conducted on proteomic and transcriptomic data obtained from human valve interstitial cells (VICs) and osteoblasts. The analysis focuses on these cells both before and after induction of osteogenic differentiation. The source of this analysis stems from the article titled "Similar, but not the same: multi-omics comparison of human valve interstitial cells and osteoblast osteogenic differentiation expanded with an estimation of data-dependent and data-independent PASEF" article.
